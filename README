Notes for testing locally (assumes Mac OS X)

GitHub Pages use Jekyll to serve up rendered pages (https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)

Assuming you're using Home Brew, you'll need to install the latest version of Ruby and then
the Jekyll gem (yes, I know OS X ships with Ruby and Home Brew is a Ruby script, but the
shipped version of Ruby is ancient (1.8.7 on Lion) compared with 1.9.3p327 via Home Brew).

You'll also need to install the gem for RedCloth which is needed to serve .textile pages
but which (oddly) isn't a dependency of Jekyll

$ brew install ruby
$ sudo gem install jekyll
$ sudo gem install RedCloth

Then from the root of this repository, start the Jekyll server using the GitHub defaults
(note the Home Brew installs gem binaries into the Cellar and not symlinked into
/usr/local/bin) (https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages)

$ /usr/local/Cellar/ruby/1.9.3p327/bin/jekyll --server --pgyments --no-lsi --safe

Finally point your browser at http://localhost:4000 and you should see the Mapstraction
home page being locally hosted
