	<h2>Why Use Mapstraction?</h2>
	<p>Code your application once and once only; then switch your mapping provider as you desire, depending on your personal tastes, the quality of maps in your area or any other reason you can think of.</p>
	<p>Switching mapping providers in Mapstraction is often as simple as changing just two lines of code in your application.</p>
