        <h2>About Mapstraction</h2>
        <p>Mapstraction is a library that provides a common API for various javascript mapping APIs to enable switching from one to another as smoothly as possible. Developers can code their applications once, and then easily switch mapping provider based on project needs, terms and conditions, and new functionality.</p>
        <p>Users can switch maps as desired based on personal taste and quality of maps in their local area. Various tools built on top of Mapstraction allow users to easily integrate maps into their own sites, and configure them with different controls, styles, and provider.</p>

        <h2>Why Mapstraction?</h2>

          <p>Mapstraction is open-source and released under the BSD License.</p>
