	<h2>Points and Bounding Boxes</h2>
	<p>For almost everything you'd want to do with a map, you need to be able to tell Mapstraction where on the Earth's surface you want to do things, such as show the map, centre the map, display a marker and so on. The fundamental building blocks for this are two Javascript classes, <code>mxn.LatLonPoint</code> and <code>mxn.BoundingBox</code>.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
	<h2>Points</h2>
	<p>As the name suggests, a point describes a specific point on the Earth's surface, expressed as a pair of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude">latitude</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude">longitude</a> coordinates; the latitude specifies the north/south position and the longitude specifies the east/west position.</p>
	<p>For example, to specify the centre of London you would create a <code>mxn.LatLonPoint</code> with a latitude of <code>51.50731</code> and a longitude of <code>-0.12768</code>, as shown below.</p>
	
{% highlight javascript %}
var point = new mxn.LatLonPoint(51.50731, -0.12768);
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

<div class="section">
	<h2>Bounding Boxes</h2>
	<p>Another commonly used way of describing a place on the Earth's surface is with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_bounding_box">bounding box</a>, sometimes referred to as a minimum bounding rectangle or MBR. Whereas a latitude/longitude point describes a single, specific, point a bounding box describes a larger area, expressed as a rectangle with coordinates for the south west and north east corners The <code>mxn.BoundingBox</code> Mapstraction class allows you to easily create and manage bounding boxes.</p>
	<p>Following on from the London example above, the area of Greater London can be described by two points, <code>51.28, -0.489</code> for the south west corner and <code>51.686, 0.236</code> for the north east corner.</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
var bb = new mxn.BoundingBox(51.28, -0.489, 51.686, 0.236);
{% endhighlight %}

	<p>It's important to note that a bounding box is not the precise or exact outline of the place that it's representing, it's merely the smallest rectangle that will cover all the points of the place.</p>
